# Symfony_Learning

This is my project at applying the skills I gain throuout my journey of learning Symfony framework and php.

I'm following a course which is spread in sections. 

I will commit and push to the 'testing' branch after every video . After I complete  1 section I will push  it to the main and repeat.

After the 8 hrs I am spending at the office, my notes from the OneNote will be attached bellow with the date,  for better track of progress.

If you find my repo, I hope it can help you too.

Thanks!
